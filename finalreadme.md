# Motivation
There are a few reasons for why I chose my capstone topic:
  1. I have an interest in public health. I have worked in healthcare for the past seven years, and it is well understood how dietary choices have a great impact on one's health.
  2. I love food. We can all agree that food is on the short list of 'things' that are loved by every single human on this planet. The availability of delicious food is a concern for everybody. The availability of healthy and nutricious food may be less of a concern for some, yet it is an even more important matter.
  3. The Piggly Wiggly on West End closed up shop after years of providing fresh groceries to local residents. I happen to live very close to this Piggly Wiggly. Now keep in mind I never really shopped there much at all - but that doesn't mean other people didn't. The closure of a large number of people's only local grocery store meant that purchasing fresh food became a lot more difficult and involved. One of the concepts encompassing this problem is the idea of the food desert.
  4. Food deserts are something that I have been familiar with for a little while now, but I still didn't know a whole lot. As I previously mentioned, I never really shop at the now shuttered Piggly Wiggly. I choose to drive down West End to either the Kroger, Publix, and occasionally Trader Joe's. These grocery stores are around 2.5 miles from my house, and it isn't the biggest hassle driving to them. Not everyone has use of a car like I do, for one reason or another.

# What is a Food Desert?
The exact definition of what a food desert is seems to still be developing, based on some of the material I read. One particularly important characteristic is that in the context of distance traveled/commuted, any distance to a grocery store that is greater than one mile in an urban setting will place someone in a food desert. This characteristic changes when looking at rural communities, where the distance is increased to ten miles. Some academic studies include household income levels as one of the metrics observed. There is also the decision about if whether or not convenience stores, corner markets, and restaurants should be considered when looking at food sources. Another important dimension is the presence or lack of transportation, whether it's a personally owned vehicle, or public transportation.
